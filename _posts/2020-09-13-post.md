We're pleased to launch the new Unscripted Playtesting Program portal today, which provides a streamlined experience for signing up the beta program and reading the latest updates.

## What's included

The brand new portal includes the following base links:

- A page to our [playtesting guidelines][guidelines]
- And updates section with posts from the Unscripted Team on changes to the beta program
- A new details page that outlines the details of the beta program

We hope to add more features soon such as a decidated release notes page that sync with our developer release notes and more.
